# Metos3D

 Marine Ecosystem Toolkit for Optimization and Simulation in 3-D

## About Metos3D

### What is Metos3D?

Metos3D is a collection of

- simulation software ([simpack](https://github.com/metos3d/simpack/))
- optimization software ([optpack](https://github.com/metos3d/optpack/))
- chemical / biogeochemical / marine ecosystem [models](https://github.com/metos3d/model/)
- transport and forcing [data](https://github.com/metos3d/data/)

that is based on the [Transport Matrix Method](https://github.com/samarkhatiwala/tmm).

### What is Metos3D for?

Metos3D can be used for

- simulation of
- computation of annual periodic steady-states of
- parameter estimates for

chemical / biogeochemical / marine ecosystem models coupled to global 3-D ocean circulation.

See: [[Piwonski and Slawig, 2016]](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3729/2016/)

### Why was Metos3D developed?

In the field of climate research and ocean simulation, marine ecosystem models still entail the most uncertainties.
Therefore

- an application programming interface for biogeochemical models [BGC API](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-reference.html) was designed and
- a comprehensive, state-of-the-art, high-performance software based on [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/index.html) was built around it.

See: [[Piwonski and Slawig, 2016]](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3729/2016/)

### How do I use Metos3D?

Have a look into the [Metso3D docs](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs), specifically the

- [Metos3D cheat sheet](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-cheat-sheet.md).
- [Metos3D BGC API reference](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-bgc-api-reference.md).
- [Metos3D tutorial](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-tutorial.md).

## Install Metos3D

> **Note:** For the time being, we only support Linux-x86_64 platforms as easy install.

### Easy install

Install the [Miniconda/Python3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) distribution if haven't done already:

```sh
curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# accept the license agreement ...
# let the installer modify your PATH ...
```

Install Metos3D using the just installed `conda` command:

```sh
conda install -c jpicau metos3d
```

### Custom install

Refer to [Metso3D custom install](https://github.com/jpicau/metos3d/blob/master/docs/metos3d-custom-install.md) for a detailed discussion.
